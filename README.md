Most of my repositories are in python and many are for doing ETL on various web APIs.
The most interesting ones are
* [etltools](https://github.com/kevingoldsmith/etlutils): an open source library (contributions welcome!) with useful tools for ETL
* [Spotify Extract](https://github.com/kevingoldsmith/spotify-extract): download your recently played tracks
* [Oura Extract](https://github.com/kevingoldsmith/oura-extract): download your Oura Ring data
